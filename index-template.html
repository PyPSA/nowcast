	  <h1>Nowcast: Tomorrow's power system with today's weather</h1>
	  <p>This website simulates how a renewable power system of tomorrow
	    would behave with today's demand and weather.</p>
	  <p>Wind and solar from today's day-ahead forecasts are scaled up to
            projected capacities for tomorrow. <b>The model can only see 24 hours ahead.</b></p>
          <p>The dispatch of wind, solar, existing hydroelectricity, batteries and
hydrogen storage are optimised over 24 hours to meet demand. The long-term hydrogen
storage is dispatched assuming a constant hydrogen value (e.g. 80 &euro;/MWh).</p>
	  <p>Currently the website only works for Germany as an island system with today's demand. Extensions will follow soon!</p>

	  <h2>Explore scenarios</h2>
	  <ul>
	    {% for scenario in scenarios %}
              <li><a href="html/{{scenario}}.html">{{ scenarios[scenario]["name"] }}</a> ({{ scenarios[scenario]["description"] }})</li>
 	    {% endfor %}
	  </ul>
	  <h2>Technical details</h2>
	  <p>The demand is taken as the network load (Netzlast) from <a href="https://www.smard.de/home">SMARD</a>. No corrections are applied.</p>
	  <p>For the solar PV, wind onshore, wind offshore and hydroelectric generation, the generation time series are taken from <a href="https://www.smard.de/home">SMARD</a>. Since they don't reflect all generators (particularly for hydroelectricity, but also for solar PV), they are corrected by yearly correction factors based on the net generation statistics from <a href="https://ag-energiebilanzen.de/daten-und-fakten/zusatzinformationen/">AG Energiebilanzen e.V.</a>. For the current year, the previous year's correction factor is used. You can check out the <a href="./correction_factors.csv">correction factors</a>.</p>
	  <p>This correction scheme for generation follows the <a href="https://www.agora-energiewende.org/fileadmin/Projekte/Agorameter/2023-10-01_Hintergrunddokumentation_Agorameter_v13_EN.pdf">Agorameter</a>.</p>
	  <p>The time series are then scaled down to per unit time series using the historical capacities reported by <a href="https://www.energy-charts.info/">energy-charts</a>, before being scaled back up to their projected capacities.</p>
	  <h2>Warnings</h2>
	  <p>Currently the website has many limitations. It is only a prototype; it will improve over time. Important limitations and their effects include:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Germany is currently treated as an island; no exchanges of electricity or hydrogen are allowed with other countries. Relaxing this condition would lower costs.</li>
	    <li>Network constraints and redispatch costs inside Germany are ignored. Including network bottlenecks would raise costs.</li>
	    <li>In reality the value of hydrogen could change seasonally, like natural gas does, and also be affected by other hydrogen demands (e.g. in industry) and hydrogen trade.</li>
	    <li>We have not assumed any demand flexibility for conventional electricity demand. Electrolysers and batteries charge based on market signals.</li>
	    <li>Potential new demands like heat pumps, electric vehicles and hydrogen for industry are not yet implemented.</li>
	    <li>Existing biomass electricity generation is not included, because biomass should be restricted to sustainable sources and prioritised for sectors like industrial feedstocks and long-distance aviation rather than electricity.</li>
	    <li>The future effects of climate change on weather are not considered.</li>
	    <li>Short-term forecasting errors, balancing costs and other ancilliary services are ignored.</li>
	    <li>Other generation technologies, such as geothermal, nuclear, fossil fuels with CCS, wave, solar in space, etc., are not included.</li>
	    <li>Other storage technologies, such as iron-air batteries, etc., could lower costs.</li>
	    <li>Scaling up existing wind profiles will underestimate yields, because new turbines achieve higher capacity factors than the average existing turbine (e.g. because of higher hub heights).</li>
	    <li>On the other hand, locations for additional wind and solar turbines may have lower yields than the sites used today.</li>
	    <li>Increasing wake effects for offshore wind with rising capacity are ignored.</li>
	  </ul>
